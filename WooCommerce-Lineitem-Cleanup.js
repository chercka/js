/*
For use in Zapier.com's 'code action' which allows for manipulation of code via js.
Made for a project where new WooCommerce orders automatically create new events in a Google Calendar, specifically dropoff and pickup 
dates for a rental company that delivers/picks up equipment from customers. Since the customer wanted easy to read google cal descriptions,
we had to strip out unnecessary data from the order API.

The script takes WooCommerce's Abstract Order array 'line_items', which Zapier unfortunately converts to one long string, finds product names and quantities in it, and outputs only them.  
This is to avoid the unnecessary output of meta, price, tax, sku, etc as well as to remedy items and their quantities displaying in two different arrays, like so:
	
	sku:
	tax:
	etc:
	meta:
	etc:
	name: Product1, Product2, Product3
	quantity: 2,1,4
	
Instead we get

	Product1
	2
	Product2
	1
	Product3
	4

//Zapier expects an object called 'output' back, even though it's overkill in this case. So we give it an object with only one item. Any added items will show up as their own fields within Zapier.
